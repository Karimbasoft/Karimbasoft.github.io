# Hera - Emergency SMS App

Imagine you are in an emergency situation and you don't have much time or strength to call your contacts or write them a message. To make this easier you can press the emergency button in the Hera app and it will automatically send an SMS to your contacts, in which the current location is also sent.


The location can be sent either as position coordinates or as a Google Maps link to show your emergency contact your position directly on the map.

In addition to the SMS, an alarm tone can also be played to draw attention to yourself acoustically.
In addition to sending the location data, the position can also be displayed and shared, e.g. via WhatsApp.
